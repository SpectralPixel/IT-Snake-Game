# IT-Snake-Game

A game I am making for my IT Elective subject (Grade 9 2022-23). The original idea was "slither.io with guns" but then I realized it doesn't really make much sense from a gameplay perspective so the project is going more in a "slither.io with powerups" direction.

Did I mention it has to run on a Raspberry Pi 3B?
