What the duck did you just funking say about me, you little ditch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the luck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my sucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shoot to me over the Internet? Think again, tucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, nugget. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're trucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable bass off the face of the continent, you little shot. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your yucky tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, your god's dam is an idiot. I will lift fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're big king dead, kiddo.

Time to teach you about type matchups Maybe you've heard about the classic type triangle Water is super effective against fire, fire is super effective against grass, and grass is super effective against water Conversely, fire is not very effective against water, grass is not very effective against fire, and  water is not very effective against grass Well, time to expand from this novice type triangle There are more triangles in terms of type matchups, if you look close enough An example of this is fighting, rock, and flying Fighting is super effective against rock, rock is super effective against flying, and flying is super effective against fighting You can also see that the same thing is the case for the fact that rock is not very effective against fighting, flying is not very effective against rock, and fighting is not very effective against flying People often like to rank types into usefullness. I personally find all types to have their own uses, but there are 3 types in particular that I think should be on every, if not almost every, team. Ground, fighting, and steel are these types. Ground and fighting are both incredibly strong offensive types. Ground can hit fifteen types for effective or higher damage, and can hit fire, electric, poison, rock, and steel for super effective damage. Also, Pok√©mon like Groudon, Landorus (and its Therian form), and Zygarde benefit from this type since they can hit a lot of things for big damage. Reminder, super effective states that you do 2x more damage, and not very effective states that you do 0.5x damage. Another reminder, STAB stands for Same Type Attack Bonus, and is why you often want to teach your Pok√©mon moves that match their typing Not in every case, sometimes you just want a Pok√©mon that has status moves, which do not inherently cause damage, but may be in some cases, like the move Toxic, a side effect of the move. But hitting the enemy Pok√©mon for big damage is vital for winning fights. Anyways, back to what I was saying before. Ground is one of the rare types, however, that can hit a typing for no effect. That is it's biggest weakness, because flying is also an optimal type that can find a good time switching into an Earthquake, which is an 100 base power move that hits everyone on the field. In addition, there are two abilities (Levitate and Earth Eater) that can either prevent being attacked by ground type moves no matter the defending Pok√©mon's type, but also can heal such Pok√©mon by a solid amount when receiving damage from a ground type move. It is also not very effective against bug and grass, but add a fire typing to your Pok√©mon, and although you are 4x weak to a water type move, in the case of a Pok√©mon with such typing and Steam Engine, like Coalossal, and you have a pretty crazy Pok√©mon. Of course, there is always a way to hit the Pok√©mon. Adding a fire typing adds more weaknesses. But you get the point. Moving on to fighting, fighting can hit 12 types for effective or super effective damage, although it does find itself not very effective to 5 different types that are more powerful, and it has no effect against ghost type Pok√©mon. Pok√©mon like Lucario, Koraidon, Annihilape, and Mega Blaziken benefit from this type since they can hit a lot of things for big damage. Steel, on the other hand, is a great defensive typing. It gets multiple resistances, against 10 different types, and one Pok√©mon, Poison, has no effect on it. The only case of any Poison thing hitting a Steel type Pok√©mon is if a Poison type has Corrosion and uses Toxic. Some good defensive Pok√©mon with this type are Ferrothorn, Zamazenta Crowned, and Corviknight.
If you were interested in Pok√©mon but forgot about all of this, I hope I helped reignite that spark.

Clodsire and Brambleghast are probably my top 2 favorite new generation 9 Pok√©mon. Ignore the fact that one of them is just a big bean Pok√©mon and the other one is tumbleweed.
